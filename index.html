<a id="multi-user-dungeon-server" class="anchor" href="#multi-user-dungeon-server" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Multi User Dungeon Server</h1>

<p>This MUD server started as a hackathon project at the Berlin Google DevFest 2013 which hat
the topic "Retro" so i thought a MUD Server that is using XML as config is pretty retro.</p>

<p>The 2015 edition of Berlin Google DevFest was coming and the topic "ASCII" was a easy
pick for me and so i worked again on the MUD Server</p>

<h2>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<p>At first the feature that is not existent: password protection, just a username and you are in.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rooms" class="anchor" href="#rooms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rooms</h3>

<p>All levels/rooms/area are defined by a XML files per room, so you can merge different "worlds"
by just copying all the files in to one folder and create a connecting room</p>

<p>All the room need to have a unique key by whom they are identified by the server. These keys
are also used for directions.</p>

<h3>
<a id="directions" class="anchor" href="#directions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Directions</h3>

<p>Directions can have a free form name which must be unique per room and need to to have
a key of an existing room. They can also be hidden and only be seen when the look command
will be called with the direction name. You should give hints to find them.
Directions can also have one or multiple dependencies.</p>

<h3>
<a id="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h3>

<p>The dependency system in Go-MUD is based on multiple things such as places you visit,
actions you did there and attributes you have and their value.
At the moment actions and directions can be marked with dependencies.
Later this will be extended with the not yet build inventory system.</p>

<h3>
<a id="attributes" class="anchor" href="#attributes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attributes</h3>

<p>Attributes can be used as dependency for rooms, there they can be used and Min and/or Max value
filters.</p>

<h3>
<a id="actions" class="anchor" href="#actions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Actions</h3>

<p>Rooms can have multiple action which you can perform there. These actions can have and be in it self dependencies for other actions or rooms</p>

<h2>
<a id="future-work" class="anchor" href="#future-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Work</h2>

<p>Here all future ideas for Go-Mud will be listed, if you have a cool idea just add a <a href="https://github.com/woodworker/go-mud/issues">"enhancement" issue</a></p>

<h3>
<a id="inventory" class="anchor" href="#inventory" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inventory</h3>

<p>There should also be an inventory system for players and also containers in rooms that can be lootet
and also be used as storage when the player inventory is full</p>

<h3>
<a id="scripting" class="anchor" href="#scripting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scripting</h3>

<p>Some sort of scripting language maybe based on Lua or EcmaScript</p>

<h3>
<a id="plugins" class="anchor" href="#plugins" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plugins</h3>

<p>Plugins for when simple scripts are not enough</p>
