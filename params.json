{"name":"Go-mud","tagline":"Go based MUD Server","body":"# Multi User Dungeon Server\r\nThis MUD server started as a hackathon project at the Berlin Google DevFest 2013 which hat\r\nthe topic \"Retro\" so i thought a MUD Server that is using XML as config is pretty retro.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 edition of Berlin Google DevFest was coming and the topic \"ASCII\" was a easy\r\npick for me and so i worked again on the MUD Server\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nAt first the feature that is not existent: password protection, just a username and you are in.\r\n\r\n### Rooms\r\nAll levels/rooms/area are defined by a XML files per room, so you can merge different \"worlds\"\r\nby just copying all the files in to one folder and create a connecting room\r\n\r\nAll the room need to have a unique key by whom they are identified by the server. These keys\r\nare also used for directions.\r\n\r\n### Directions\r\nDirections can have a free form name which must be unique per room and need to to have\r\na key of an existing room. They can also be hidden and only be seen when the look command\r\nwill be called with the direction name. You should give hints to find them.\r\nDirections can also have one or multiple dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThe dependency system in Go-MUD is based on multiple things such as places you visit,\r\nactions you did there and attributes you have and their value.\r\nAt the moment actions and directions can be marked with dependencies.\r\nLater this will be extended with the not yet build inventory system.\r\n\r\n### Attributes\r\nAttributes can be used as dependency for rooms, there they can be used and Min and/or Max value\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\nRooms can have multiple action which you can perform there. These actions can have and be in it self dependencies for other actions or rooms\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\nHere all future ideas for Go-Mud will be listed, if you have a cool idea just add a [\"enhancement\" issue](https://github.com/woodworker/go-mud/issues)\r\n\r\n### Inventory\r\nThere should also be an inventory system for players and also containers in rooms that can be lootet\r\nand also be used as storage when the player inventory is full\r\n\r\n### Scripting\r\nSome sort of scripting language maybe based on Lua or EcmaScript\r\n\r\n### Plugins\r\nPlugins for when simple scripts are not enough\r\n\r\n# Authors and Contributors\r\n@woodworker","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
